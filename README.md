# JGR19_DropoutEchoes
The simulation data used in the manuscript "Understanding electron dropout echoes induced by interplanetary shocks: test particle simulations" submitted to JGR-space physics in 2019.

All data here are in ASCII format and in SI units.

psd_L6.6.txt - simulated phase space density evolution at L=6.6 at various energy and local time
psd_LANL_L6.6.txt - same to as psd_L6.6.txt, but with energy list appropriate for simulating the fluxes detected by LANL satellites
Trajectory_typical.txt - three typical electron trajectories and the fields experienced by them
Trajectory_valley.txt - trajectories of the electrons corresponding to the initial flux valleys at dawn
